# Welcome to the OpenSwitch Base project
This OpenSwitch repo contains the manifest file for the repo tool used to pull down sources for the OpenSwitch network adaptation service (NAS) project. The OpenSwitch Base project is the switch abstraction interface (SAI) host-adapter originally written by Dell, and contributed to the OpenSwitch project. It is assumed that you are familiar with Linux and have basic development knowledge.

See [OpenSwitch documentation] for complete information.

## Get OpenSwitch NAS
There are two ways to get the OpenSwitch Base:
- **Download and install binaries** - see [Installation] for complete information, **or**
